🔧 HOW TO FIX THE "Failed to fetch" ERROR
==========================================

The error occurs because the frontend is trying to connect to a backend server that isn't running.

QUICK FIX - Option 1 (Recommended):
-----------------------------------
1. Double-click the "start-server.bat" file in the main project folder
2. Wait for the server to start (you'll see "Server running on port 3000")
3. Refresh your webpage - the error should be gone!

MANUAL FIX - Option 2:
----------------------
1. Open Command Prompt (cmd)
2. Navigate to your project folder:
   cd "c:\Users\Sneha\Downloads\Hackathon_Project-main (4)\Hackathon_Project-main\server"
3. Install dependencies (first time only):
   npm install
4. Start the server:
   npm start
5. Keep this window open while using the app

WHAT'S HAPPENING:
-----------------
- Your frontend (HTML/JS) needs to communicate with a backend server
- The backend server handles data storage and API requests
- Without the server running, you get "Failed to fetch" errors
- The app now has offline mode as backup, but full features need the server

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- If port 3000 is busy, the server will show an error
- Close any other applications using port 3000
- Or change the port in server/server.js (line: const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000)

✅ Once the server is running, your app will work perfectly!
